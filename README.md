## Notice

The project is currently in the early stages of development and is not ready for production use. Expect breaking changes and bugs as I work on making this stable and not a bunch of ai written spaghetti code from the PoC.

## Overview

**Squad Aegis** is an all-in-one control panel designed to manage multiple Squad game servers efficiently. Whether you're running a single server or a complex cluster, Squad Aegis provides a centralized interface to keep everything under control.
