# Overview

## What are Workflows?

Workflows in Squad Aegis provide a powerful automation system that allows you to create custom responses to in-game events. When specific events occur (like a player sending a chat message or a player joining the server), workflows can automatically execute a series of actions such as sending RCON commands, logging messages, or triggering notifications.

## Basic Concepts

### Workflow Components

A workflow consists of:

- **Triggers**: Define what events will start the workflow
- **Conditions**: Optional filters to determine if the workflow should run
- **Steps**: The actions to execute when triggered
- **Variables**: Data storage for workflow execution
- **Error Handling**: How to handle failures

### Execution Flow

1. An in-game event occurs (e.g., player sends chat message)
2. Squad Aegis checks if any workflows have matching triggers
3. If conditions are met, the workflow executes its steps in order
4. Results are logged and can be used by subsequent steps
